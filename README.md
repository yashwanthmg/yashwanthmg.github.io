## üìù Projects i have worked on

# USI Portfolio & Vendor Inbound Guidelines
</h4> Company: Amazon - Sr.Manager: Neha - Team: Instock Management, Softlines

- SL USI% increased to 0.44% in Aug‚Äô22 exit (vs goal of 1%). I started leading the USI (Unsellable Inventory management) portfolio by setting up weekly mechanism with FC to identify ASIN level causes of unsellable inventory. I identified 2 major reasons of USI- a) MRP tags missing in the products either via C-return route or during supply from vendors b) minor refurbishment pending with FC for the c-return products and worked with all 13 vendors to supply separate MRP tags to FC for monthly correction of inventory. My findings also lead to modification of our Inbound and packaging vendor training deck to avoid ‚ÄúMRP tag misses‚Äù during vendor‚Äôs packaging process. Due to this efforts, USI% decreased to 0.08% in WK 39 (sep‚Äô22 exit).

# SWOOS% reduction
</h4> Company: Amazon - Sr.Manager: Neha - Team: Instock Management, Softline

- 90% of SL brands faced MOQ/FTL issues in supplying lower quantities and lead to non-fulfillment of replenishment POs. This, combined with the sales spike due to price reduction lead to 35% replen swoos% in Aug‚Äô22. Since onboarding of alternate options like enablement of ATS, SWA etc were a long pole, I quickly onboarded brands on SPN (Service Provider Network) service which connects 3P logistics partners to the brand.  90% of the brands facing MOQ issues on SPN (8 out of 9 brands facing issues) was onboarded in a span of 40 days, thus reducing Replen SWOOS% by 1100 bps (from 35% in Aug‚Äô22 to 24% in Sep‚Äô22).
